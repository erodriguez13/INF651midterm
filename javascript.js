What are some advantages of using JavaScript in web development? */

/*
Javascript provides an interface for user to use that is more dynamic as compared to html and and css alone. 
The programmer can do more than simply present information to the user. The programmer can code functions into a webpage that
can result in different response depending on the occasion, the user or any other choice the programmer chooses to. 
In the era of web 2.0, it is imperative that user can have a versatile website that they can interact with.
